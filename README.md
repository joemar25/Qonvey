## NODEJS and cli command

note, install the nodejs

commandline:
npm install @angular/cli --global

    - gives us the previlledge to use the `ng` command in our terminal directory we are in
    - without the global, it just install and you can use the cli on the folder where you install it

alternative
npm install @angular/cli --global --directory .

    - for creating in the current directory

ng new ProjectTemplate

    - SASS [/] - Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.
    - SSR [/] - the Server-side rendering (SSR) is the process of rendering a a fully frontend application on the server, rather than in the browser. The rendered HTML is then sent to the client, where it can be displayed by the web browser.
    - SSG [/] - is a process of creating a website as a set of static HTML files, rather than a dynamic web application. This can be useful for websites that do not require frequent updates or user interactions, and can benefit from the performance and scalability of static hosting.
